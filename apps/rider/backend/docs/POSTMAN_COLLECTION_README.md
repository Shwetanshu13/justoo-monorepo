## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Import the Collection

1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import" button
3. Select "File" tab
4. Choose `Rider_Backend_Postman_Collection.json`
5. Click "Import"

### 2. Set Environment Variables

The collection uses the following variables (automatically managed):

- `{{base_url}}` - API base URL (default: `http://localhost:3006/api`)
- `{{auth_token}}` - JWT authentication token (auto-saved after login)
- `{{rider_id}}` - Current rider ID (auto-saved after login)
- `{{order_id}}` - Order ID for testing (set manually)
- `{{notification_id}}` - Notification ID for testing (set manually)

### 3. Test the APIs

#### Authentication Flow:

1. **First, register a rider** using "Register Rider" request
2. **Then login** using "Login Rider" request (this automatically saves the auth token)
3. **All other requests** will now use the saved authentication token

#### Testing Order Flow:

1. Use "Get Assigned Orders" to see available orders
2. Copy an order ID and set it as `{{order_id}}` variable
3. Test order operations like "Accept Order", "Update Order Status"
4. Test delivery operations in the Delivery Management folder

#### Testing Notifications:

1. Use "Get Notifications" to see current notifications
2. Copy a notification ID and set it as `{{notification_id}}` variable
3. Test notification operations

## 📝 Request Examples
